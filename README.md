This assignment seeks to complete the In-Class assignment 2 for WebWare. It is coied off of my code for A2, but the only relevant files are the index, main.js, and main.css.

I was not present in class, but consulted with Emma Herman and Matthew Papesh for ideas on stategies. 

I used FlexBox for formatting.
